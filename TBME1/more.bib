@article{Spielman2012,
abstract = {We consider the problem of learning sparsely used dictionaries with an arbitrary square dictionary and a random, sparse coefficient matrix. We prove that \$O (n \backslash log n)\$ samples are sufficient to uniquely determine the coefficient matrix. Based on this proof, we design a polynomial-time algorithm, called Exact Recovery of Sparsely-Used Dictionaries (ER-SpUD), and prove that it probably recovers the dictionary and coefficient matrix when the coefficient matrix is sufficiently sparse. Simulation results show that ER-SpUD reveals the true dictionary as well as the coefficients with probability higher than many state-of-the-art algorithms.},

@article{Wheeler1991,
abstract = {For over half a century neuroscientists have distinguished extracellularly recorded action potentials on the basis of distinguishing features of their waveforms, notably spike height and width. The improvements first in electronics and now in inexpensive computers have made possible automated spike sorting using a variety of sophisticated algorithms, both off-line and in real-time. As multiple element electrode arrays come into widespread use, practical spike sorting technology will be necessary in order to avoid the need to 'employ one graduate student for each channel' in order to make sense of the volume of incoming data. This talk will review basic spike sorting algorithms, including autoclassifying and adaptive approaches. The discussion will also include the processing requirements for realtime applications and observations on the limits of accurate sorting.},

@book{Rieke1997,
abstract = {What does it mean to say that a certain set of spikes is the right answer to a computational problem? In what sense does a spike train convey information about the sensory world? Spikes begins by providing precise formulations of these and related questions about the representation of sensory signals in neural spike trains. The answers to these questions are then pursued in experiments on sensory neurons.Intended for neurobiologists with an interest in mathematical analysis of neural data as well as the growing number of physicists and mathematicians interested in information processing by "real" nervous systems, Spikes provides a self-contained review of relevant concepts in information theory and statistical decision theory.},

@article{Nicolelis2009,
abstract = {Research on brain-machine interfaces has been ongoing for at least a decade. During this period, simultaneous recordings of the extracellular electrical activity of hundreds of individual neurons have been used for direct, real-time control of various artificial devices. Brain-machine interfaces have also added greatly to our knowledge of the fundamental physiological principles governing the operation of large neural ensembles. Further understanding of these principles is likely to have a key role in the future development of neuroprosthetics for restoring mobility in severely paralysed patients.},

@article{Einevoll2012,
abstract = {The new generation of silicon-based multielectrodes comprising hundreds or more electrode contacts offers unprecedented possibilities for simultaneous recordings of spike trains from thousands of neurons. Such data will not only be invaluable for finding out how neural networks in the brain work, but will likely be important also for neural prosthesis applications. This opportunity can only be realized if efficient, accurate and validated methods for automatic spike sorting are provided. In this review we describe some of the challenges that must be met to achieve this goal, and in particular argue for the critical need of realistic model data to be used as ground truth in the validation of spike-sorting algorithms.},
