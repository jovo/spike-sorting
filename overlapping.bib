abstract = {For the analysis of neuronal cooperativity, simultaneously recorded extracellular signals from neighboring neurons need to be sorted reliably by a spike sorting method. Many algorithms have been developed to this end, however, to date, none of them manages to fulfill a set of demanding requirements. In particular, it is desirable to have an algorithm that operates online, detects and classifies overlapping spikes in real time, and that adapts to non-stationary data. Here, we present a combined spike detection and classification algorithm, which explicitly addresses these issues. Our approach makes use of linear filters to find a new representation of the data and to optimally enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce a method called "Deconfusion" which de-correlates the filter outputs and provides source separation. Finally, a set of well-defined thresholds is applied and leads to simultaneous spike detection and spike classification. By incorporating a direct feedback, the algorithm adapts to non-stationary data and is, therefore, well suited for acute recordings. We evaluate our method on simulated and experimental data, including simultaneous intra/extra-cellular recordings made in slices of a rat cortex and recordings from the prefrontal cortex of awake behaving macaques. We compare the results to existing spike detection as well as spike sorting methods. We conclude that our algorithm meets all of the mentioned requirements and outperforms other methods under realistic signal-to-noise ratios and in the presence of overlapping spikes.},

@article{Adamos2010,
abstract = {Background noise and spike overlap pose problems in contemporary spike-sorting strategies. We attempted to resolve both issues by introducing a hybrid scheme that combines the robust representation of spike waveforms to facilitate the reliable identification of contributing neurons with efficient data learning to enable the precise decomposition of coactivations. The isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) technique reveals the intrinsic data structure, helps with recognising the involved neurons and, simultaneously, identifies the overlaps. Exemplar activation patterns are first estimated for all detected neurons and consecutively used to build a synthetic database in which spike overlaps are systematically varied and realistic noise is added. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is then trained with the ISOMAP representation of this database and learns to associate the synthesised waveforms with the corresponding source neurons. The trained ELM is finally applied to the actual overlaps from the experimental data and this completes the entire spike-sorting process. Our approach is better characterised as semi-supervised, noise-assisted strategy of an empirical nature. The user's engagement is restricted at recognising the number of active neurons from low-dimensional point-diagrams and at deciding about the complexity of overlaps. Efficiency is inherited from the incorporation of well-established algorithms. Moreover, robustness is guaranteed by adaptation to the actual noise properties of a given data set. The validity of our work has been verified via extensive experimentation, using realistically simulated data, under different levels of noise.},

@article{Herbst2008a,
abstract = {The ability to detect and sort overlapping spike waveforms in extracellular recordings is key to studies of neural coding at high spatial and temporal resolution. Most spike-sorting algorithms are based on initial spike detection (e.g. by a voltage threshold) and subsequent waveform classification. Much effort has been devoted to the clustering step, despite the fact that conservative spike detection is notoriously difficult in low signal-to-noise conditions and often entails many spike misses. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) can serve as generative models for continuous extracellular data records. These models naturally combine the spike detection and classification steps into a single computational procedure. They unify the advantages of independent component analysis (ICA) and overlap-search algorithms because they blindly perform source separation even in cases where several neurons are recorded on a single electrode. We apply HMMs to artificially generated data and to extracellular signals recorded with glass electrodes. We show that in comparison with state-of-art spike-sorting algorithms, HMM-based spike sorting exhibits a comparable number of false positive spike classifications but many fewer spike misses.},

@article{Vargas-Irwin2007,
abstract = {In multiple cell recordings identifying the number of neurons and assigning each action potential to a particular source, commonly referred to as 'spike sorting', is a highly non-trivial problem. Density grid contour clustering provides a computationally efficient way of locating high-density regions of arbitrary shape in low-dimensional space. When applied to waveforms projected onto their first two principal components, the algorithm allows the extraction of templates that provide high-dimensional reference points that can be used to perform accurate spike sorting. Template matching using subtractive waveform decomposition can locate these templates in waveform samples despite the influence of noise, spurious threshold crossing and waveform overlap. Tests with a large synthetic dataset incorporating realistic challenges faced during spike sorting (including overlapping and phase-shifted spikes) reveal that this strategy can consistently yield results with less than 6\% false positives and false negatives (and less than 2\% for high signal-to-noise ratios) at processing speeds exceeding those previously reported for similar algorithms by more than an order of magnitude.},

@article{Bar-Gad2001,
abstract = {Recording of multiple neurons from a single electrode is common practice during extra-cellular recordings. Separation and sorting of spikes originating from the different neurons can be performed either on-line or off-line using multiple methods for pattern matching. However, all spike sorting techniques fail either fully or partially in identifying spikes from multiple neurons when they overlap due to occurrence within a short time interval. This failure, that we termed the ‘shadowing effect’, causes the well-known phenomenon of decreased cross-correlation at zero offset. However, the shadowing effect also causes other artifacts in the auto and cross-correlation of the recorded neurons. These artifacts are significant mainly in brain areas with high firing rate or increased firing synchrony leading to a high probability of spike overlap. Cross correlation of cells recorded from the same electrodes tends to reflect the autocorrelation functions of the two cells, even when there are no functional interactions between the cells. Therefore, the cross-correlation function tends to have a short-term (about the length of the refractory period) peak. A long-term (hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds) trough in the cross-correlation can be seen in cells with bursting and pausing activities recorded from the same electrode. Even the autocorrelation functions of the recorded neurons feature firing properties of other neurons recorded from the same electrode. Examples of these effects are given from our recordings in the globus pallidus of behaving primates and from the literature. Results of simulations of independent simple model neurons exhibit the same properties as the recorded neurons. The effect is analyzed and can be estimated to enable better evaluation of the underlying firing patterns and the actual synchronization of neighboring neurons recorded by a single electrode.},

@article{Pedreira2012,
abstract = {Recent studies highlighted the disagreement between the typical number of neurons observed with extracellular recordings and the ones to be expected based on anatomical and physiological considerations. This disagreement has been mainly attributed to the presence of sparsely firing neurons. However, it is also possible that this is due to limitations of the spike sorting algorithms used to process the data. To address this issue, we used realistic simulations of extracellular recordings and found a relatively poor spike sorting performance for simulations containing a large number of neurons. In fact, the number of correctly identified neurons for single-channel recordings showed an asymptotic behavior saturating at about 8-10 units, when up to 20 units were present in the data. This performance was significantly poorer for neurons with low firing rates, as these units were twice more likely to be missed than the ones with high firing rates in simulations containing many neurons. These results uncover one of the main reasons for the relatively low number of neurons found in extracellular recording and also stress the importance of further developments of spike sorting algorithms.},
